## Key Principles

- **Multiplayer-First**: Every feature must work with RimWorld Multiplayer
- **AsyncTime Integration**: Use AsyncTime for safe background operations
- **Performance Focused**: Optimize TPS for large colonies
- **Mod Compatibility**: Work well with other popular mods

## File Organization

- All C# files use English comments
- Russian documentation for internal use only
- Harmony patches organized by system (RW_Patches/, Multiplayer_Patches/, etc.)
- Core systems separated from patches for clarity
