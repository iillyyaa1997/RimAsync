# Makefile Usage Rules

## 📋 Makefile Commands Available

RimAsync has a comprehensive Makefile with convenient commands for all development tasks. **ALWAYS use Makefile commands instead of raw Docker commands** for consistency and better UX.

### 🏗️ Build Commands

- `make build` - Full build in Docker container (replaces: docker-compose up build)
- `make quick-build` - Quick incremental build  
- `make release` - Production release build

### 🧪 Test Commands  

- `make test` - Run all tests in Docker (replaces: docker-compose up test)
- `make test-unit` - Run unit tests only
- `make test-integration` - Run integration tests only  
- `make test-performance` - Run performance tests only
- `make test-run [TARGET="..."] [OPTS="..."]` - Universal test runner (interactive)
- `make test-quick` - Quick test menu (4 most common options)
- `make test-find NAME="SearchTerm"` - Smart search for tests by name
- `make t` - Super quick unit tests (fastest)

### 📊 Code Coverage Commands (MANDATORY for individual testing)

- `make coverage-quick` - Quick coverage for unit tests (daily development)
- `make coverage` - Full coverage report for all tests
- `make coverage-html` - HTML coverage report with visual analysis

- `make docker-info` - Show Docker environment info

### 📦 Distribution Commands

- `make package` - Create distribution package  
- `make deploy-local` - Deploy to local RimWorld mods directory (macOS)

### 🔄 Workflow Shortcuts

- `make cycle` - Full development cycle: clean → build → test
- `make quick-cycle` - Quick cycle: build → test
- `make status` - Git status + Docker build info
- `make help` - Show all available commands

## 🚨 MANDATORY Makefile Usage Rules

### 1. **Always Prefer Makefile Commands**

```bash
✅ CORRECT:   make build
❌ WRONG:     docker-compose up build

✅ CORRECT:   make test  
❌ WRONG:     docker-compose up test

✅ CORRECT:   make clean
❌ WRONG:     docker-compose down
```

### 2. **When to Use Raw Docker Commands**  

- Only when debugging Makefile issues
- When Makefile command doesn't exist for specific need
- When instructed explicitly by user

### 3. **Command Suggestions**

When user asks for:

- **"build"** → suggest `make build`
- **"test"** → suggest `make test`
- **"clean"** → suggest `make clean`
- **"help"** → suggest `make help`
- **"setup"** → suggest `make setup`

### 4. **Makefile Integration with Cursor Commands**

#### @execute-task Integration

```bash
# Instead of docker-compose commands, use:
make build          # For compilation
make test           # For testing  
make quick-cycle    # For build + test workflow
```

#### @run-tests Integration

```bash
make test                 # All tests
make test-unit           # Unit tests only
make test-integration    # Integration tests  
make test-performance    # Performance tests
make test-run TARGET="..." # Universal test runner
make t                   # Super quick unit tests

# MANDATORY coverage for individual tests:
make coverage-quick      # Quick coverage (daily development)
make coverage           # Full coverage report
make coverage-html      # HTML coverage analysis
```

#### @analyze-logs Integration

```bash
make logs           # View container logs
make status         # Git + Docker status
make docker-info    # Docker environment info
```

## 🎯 Common Development Workflows

### 🚀 Starting Development

```bash
make setup          # Initial setup (first time)
make docker-info    # Verify Docker environment  
make build          # Build project
make test           # Run tests
```

### 🔄 Daily Development

```bash
make status         # Check current state
make quick-cycle    # Build + test
make dev            # Start dev environment
```

### 🧹 Maintenance

```bash
make clean          # Clean Docker resources
make format         # Format code
make lint          # Run analysis
```

### 🚀 Release Preparation

```bash
make cycle          # Full clean cycle
make security-scan  # Security check
make package        # Create package
make deploy-local   # Test locally
```

## 💡 Makefile Benefits

### ✅ Advantages of Using Makefile

- **Consistency**: Same commands work for everyone
- **Simplicity**: `make build` vs `docker-compose up build --remove-orphans`
- **Color Output**: Better visual feedback
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error checking
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting with `make help`
- **Workflow Integration**: Combines multiple steps
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, Windows (with WSL)

### 🎨 Visual Feedback

- **Cyan**: Command descriptions  
- **Green**: Success messages
- **Yellow**: Warnings and info
- **Red**: Errors and confirmations

## 🔧 Makefile Maintenance

### When to Update Makefile

- Adding new Docker services to docker-compose.yml
- Creating new test categories
- Adding deployment targets
- Introducing new development workflows

### How to Add New Commands

1. Add .PHONY target
2. Add help description with ##
3. Use color variables for consistent output
4. Follow existing naming conventions
5. Update this rules file

## 📝 Example Usage in AI Responses

When user asks to build:

```
🏗️ Building RimAsync using Makefile...

make build

This will:
- Use Docker container for compilation
- Show colored progress output  
- Handle errors gracefully
- Clean up automatically
```

When user asks for help:

```
📋 Available commands:

make help          # Show all commands
make build         # Build project
make test          # Run tests
make dev           # Start development  
make clean         # Clean environment

Use `make help` for complete list with descriptions.
```

## 🚨 MANDATORY Coverage Requirements

### When Testing Individual Components

**ALWAYS include coverage when running specific tests instead of full test suite:**

```bash
❌ WRONG:   make test-unit
✅ CORRECT: make test-unit && make coverage-quick

❌ WRONG:   make test-run TARGET="AsyncManager"  
✅ CORRECT: make test-run TARGET="AsyncManager" && make coverage-quick

❌ WRONG:   make t
✅ CORRECT: make t && make coverage-quick
```

### Coverage Commands Usage

- **Daily development:** `make coverage-quick` (fastest, unit tests only)
- **Before commit:** `make coverage` (full coverage analysis)
- **Detailed analysis:** `make coverage-html` (visual HTML reports)

### Coverage Requirements

- **Unit tests:** Minimum 80% line coverage
- **Critical components:** Minimum 90% coverage  
- **New features:** 85%+ coverage before merge

### Coverage Reports Location

- **Quick reports:** `./TestResults/Coverage/Quick/`
- **Full reports:** `./TestResults/Coverage/`
- **HTML reports:** `./TestResults/Coverage/Html/index.html`
