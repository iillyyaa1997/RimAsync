## Installation

### Requirements
- **RimWorld 1.6.4630+** (REQUIRED - RimWorld 1.5 NOT SUPPORTED)
- **[Harmony](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009463077)** (required)
- **[RimWorld Multiplayer](https://github.com/rwmt/Multiplayer)** (optional, for multiplayer)

> ⚠️ **Important:** This mod ONLY works with RimWorld 1.6. If you're using RimWorld 1.5, you cannot use this mod.

### Steps
1. Subscribe on Steam Workshop *(coming soon)*
2. Enable in mod list (load after Harmony)
3. **For multiplayer:** Enable AsyncTime in Multiplayer settings
4. Enjoy improved performance!

## Development with Docker

**RimAsync uses Docker for all compilation and testing operations.**

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
- No need for local .NET SDK installation!

### 📋 Quick Commands (Makefile)
```bash
# Build the mod
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Development environment
make dev

# Quick development build
make quick-build

# Install/update mod in RimWorld
make install

# Show all available commands
make help
```

### 🎮 Installing to RimWorld

To install the mod directly to your RimWorld mods directory:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure `RIMWORLD_MODS_PATH` in `.env` if needed
3. Run `make install`

The command will automatically:
- Build the mod
- Create a distribution package
- Install or update the mod in your RimWorld directory

### 🔧 Alternative (Raw Docker)
```bash
# Build the mod
docker-compose up build

# Run tests
docker-compose up test

# Development environment
docker-compose up dev

# Quick development build
docker-compose up quick-build

# Production release build
docker-compose up release
```

### Output Directories
- `./Build/` - Development builds
- `./Release/` - Production builds ready for Steam Workshop
- `./TestResults/` - Test reports and logs

### Testing

RimAsync has comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test categories
docker-compose run --rm test dotnet test --filter Category=Unit
docker-compose run --rm test dotnet test --filter Category=Integration
docker-compose run --rm test dotnet test --filter Category=Performance
```

**Test Statistics:**
- 225+ tests with 99.6% pass rate
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for patch interactions
- Performance benchmarks for async operations
- Mock RimWorld environment for isolated testing

## Multiplayer Support

RimAsync uses the **AsyncTime setting** in RimWorld Multiplayer to enable safe background processing without affecting synchronization. This allows performance improvements while maintaining perfect multiplayer stability.

**Setup for multiplayer:**
- Install RimWorld Multiplayer
- Enable AsyncTime in Multiplayer settings
- RimAsync automatically detects and adapts

## Debug Overlay

Press **F11** in-game to toggle the debug overlay, which displays:

- **TPS (Ticks Per Second)** - Current game performance
- **Cache Statistics** - Hit rate, misses, evictions
- **Async Operations** - Active background tasks
- **Thread Status** - Current thread utilization
- **Settings** - Active configuration

The overlay helps monitor performance and diagnose issues in real-time.

## Settings

RimAsync provides extensive configuration options:

### Performance Settings
- **Async Pathfinding** - Enable background path calculation
- **Async AI** - Enable background AI processing
- **Async Job Execution** - Enable background job processing
- **Async Building** - Enable background building operations
- **Smart Caching** - Enable intelligent result caching

### Thread Management
- **Auto Thread Limits** *(Recommended)* - Automatically calculates optimal thread count based on your CPU
- **Manual Thread Limit** - Set custom thread count (1-16)

### Safety Settings
- **Fallback Mechanisms** - Automatic sync fallback on errors
- **Performance Monitoring** - Track operation metrics

## Compatibility

### ✅ Compatible
- RimWorld Multiplayer
- Most performance and UI mods
- Vanilla-friendly mods

### ❌ Incompatible
- Other threading/performance mods
- Mods that heavily modify tick loops
